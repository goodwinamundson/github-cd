The Game has three different screens: "Start" screen, "Game" screen, and "Game over" screen.

- "Start" screen:- This screen contains the START button, by clicking the button the game begins. Custom CSS style has been
  added using linear-gradient for the background, START button, and the title.

- "Game" screen:- This screen is revealed only after clicking the START button. A random phrase is added to the display, and
  the letters of the phrase are hidden. An onscreen keyboard is present, which can be used to 'guess', i.e reveal the letters
  of the phrase. Custom CSS has been used to make the keyboard look like keys of a macbook, and changes have been made to the
  background, and 'live heart'.

- "Game over" screen:- this screen is revealed at the end of the game. If the player has 'guess', i.e. revealed all the
  letters of the onscreen phrase, a custom message notifying the game has been won is displayed. if the player has 'guessed'
  5 wrong guesses, a custom message notifying the game has been lost is displayed. The win and lose screens have different colours.
